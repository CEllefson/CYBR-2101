## AI Awareness Reflection
Describe one AI tool (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Edu, etc.) you explored.  
- How did it help (or confuse) you during setup?
  
**I disabled the Copilot AI from my VScode from my VScode because I found it distracting and felt that it was taking away my critical thinking when it was quickly presenting a solution, that may even not be a great one. For that reason I disabled that and text completion on my home desktop until I feel like I know enough that those tools will be improving my work flow rather than stymie my learning. They are good for finding errors that you cannot find so I will recognize that, but in general I have a more luddite approach to AI usage especially when learning.**

- How will you verify its suggestions in the future?

** There are a bunch of great books and online resources to use that can help learn solutions to programming. I have used AI in the past with issues I've had with Linux and it helped me great when I was at a lost, but for programming its more of learning the language syntax and problem-solving, which are two skills that will convert to any other language. You can try the code it recommends and it would likely work but there is likely a more secure, faster, and often simpler approach that requires user thought.**
